 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----|
 | - remove cypher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA and implementation of TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA            |
 | - implementation of the entire TLS Record protocol								|           
 | - possibility to transmit the password from smart card to server through TLS for authentication on a service |
 | - update RSA 1024 to RSA 2048 for client signature and encryption with server public key                     |
 | - minor changes: memory management, harden certificate checking, cleanups...                                 |
